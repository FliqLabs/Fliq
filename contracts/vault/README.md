# contracts/vault

The fliq USDC vault on NEAR: per-user balances, approved payout orders executed once, and agent spending policies. Owners: sQuiDbOb (lead), Dapper (balances), Aria (agent policy).

The plan, method names and responsibilities are in the contract team guide (FLIQ Smart Contract Team Guide, 30 Oct 2026). Scaffold with `cargo near new` in this folder and pin the toolchain in `rust-toolchain.toml`.

Rules:

- Changes to balances, permissions or outgoing transfers need two contract owners to approve.
- Fixed integer token amounts only. No `unwrap()` or `expect()` on caller-reachable paths.
- Tests read the canonical payout from `spec/fixtures/quote.usdc-ngn-50.json`.
- Deploys to testnet run through the `Deploy contract` workflow, approved by sQuiDbOb. No deployer keys in the repository.
